# DEVLOG.md — Agent Ultra Development Log

This file is updated by Claude Code at the end of every work session.
Read this file at the start of every session to understand previous work.

## How to Use This File

**At session start:** Read this entire file before beginning work. It tells you what happened before and what's next.

**At session end:** Add a new entry at the top of the Session Log (newest first) with:
- Date and session summary
- What was changed and why
- What's still open
- What to pick up next
- Honest status (PROVEN / PARTIALLY PROVEN / SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN / etc.)

## Current State

**Last updated:** 2026-04-01 (Session 2)

**App status:** Clean TypeScript compile (0 errors). No runtime verification yet. BrainExecutor is the sole active execution path (AgentCore.execute() delegates directly).

**Current priority:** Runtime verification of ReActLoop planning step. Requires device build and a real phone task to trace perceive→plan→act→verify loop.

**Known blockers:**
- Node.js v18.20.0 installed; React Native 0.81 / Expo / Metro require >= 20.19.4. Will hit issues at build time.
- Runtime behavior is entirely unproven — compile-clean is not proof of correctness.
- Replit prompts 12/13/14 confirmed applied (destructive tools gate, Samsung Smart Capture dismiss, stuck loop prevention, screen element classification, recent action history all present).

---

## Active Decisions

Decisions that affect ongoing work. Update as decisions are made or reversed.

- **BrainExecutor is sole active path.** AgentCore.execute() creates a new BrainExecutor per call and delegates. detectMode(), buildDynamicPrompt(), buildContext(), parseActionPlan() exist in AgentCore but are dead code on the active execution path.
- **Two-Claude workflow.** Chat Claude (claude.ai) = strategy, planning, architecture. Claude Code (this instance) = execution, validation, commits. Solution files from Chat Claude are validated against real codebase before applying.
- **react_navigate planning step applied.** ReActLoop now has planSteps() method, app context injection, plan-aware LLM prompt, and step advancement tracking. Committed f42909a.

### Session 2 — ReActLoop Planning Step + Replit Prompt Verification
- **Date:** 2026-04-01
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control)
- **Work done:**
  - Grep-verified all Replit prompt 12/13/14 fixes are applied: DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS safety gate, Samsung Smart Capture dismiss, stuck loop prevention (prevWasSameTool), TAPPABLE/TYPEABLE/SCROLLABLE screen classification, RECENT ACTIONS history injection
  - Applied SOLUTION_react_navigate_planning_step.md — 5 edits to src/core/ReActLoop.ts:
    1. Added planSteps() method — one-time AI planning call producing 3-8 ordered UI steps
    2. Added app context resolution (AppController.getActivePackage) before loop
    3. Added per-iteration app context refresh inside loop
    4. Replaced LLM fallback prompt with plan-aware version (CURRENT STEP, FULL PLAN with progress markers)
    5. Added plan step advancement logic in both deterministic and LLM paths (advance on UI change, forced advance after 2 stuck iterations)
  - Verified appHint propagation: BrainExecutor → TaskExecutor.completeWithReActLoop → ReActLoop.execute(goal, appHint)
  - TypeScript remains at 0 errors
- **Committed:** f42909a — "feat: add planning step to ReActLoop (AppAgent pattern)"
- **Status:** SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN
- **Next:** Device build and runtime test of a real phone task through the full perceive→plan→act→verify loop

### Session 1 — Clean TypeScript Baseline
- **Date:** 2026-04-01
- **Subsystems:** All (type-level fixes across the board)
- **Work done:**
  - Fixed 165 TypeScript errors → 0 across the codebase
  - Expanded UltraLogCat type with ~167 missing log categories
  - Added missing properties to UltraExecutionResult (success), Mode union (system, vision), PricingInfo (inputPer1k/outputPer1k aliases), ChatMessage.meta (requiresApproval), Genome types (config, permissions, enabled, MutationRecord/MutationResult fields)
  - Created src/types/expo-intent-launcher.d.ts to augment ActivityAction with VIEW, DEVICE_ADMIN_SETTINGS, PERMISSION_USAGE_SETTINGS
  - Fixed call sites in ~15 files: ModelRouter, TaskExecutor, AgentCore, Cortex, DeviceContext, BuildSystem, SettingsDirectory, GroupRouter, RouteHistoryStore, CostTracker, VisionPipeline, GenomeMutator, GenomeValidator, GenomeFitness, SelfImprover, app/index.tsx, app/settings.tsx
  - Fixed UltraDevLog method signatures to match actual callers (modelSetDefault, modelDiscoveryStart, modelApiResponse, etc.)
  - Confirmed architecture: AgentCore.execute() → BrainExecutor.execute() (line 587). BrainExecutor has tool loop with MAX_TOOL_TURNS=12, DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS safety gate, parseToolCall()
  - Git configured: user Dafarus, email dafarus@agentultra.local
- **Committed:** 88f29c1 — "checkpoint: clean TypeScript baseline, 0 errors"
- **Status:** SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN
- **Next:** Verify Replit prompt 12/13/14 application status in live source

### Session 0 — Pre-Claude-Code Audit (Chat Claude only)
- **Date:** Pre-2026-04-01
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control)
- **Work done:**
  - Chat Claude audited ReActLoop.ts, AgentCore.ts, TaskExecutor.ts
  - Three confirmed bugs designed for fix: self-interaction safety, memory injection into planning prompts, weather capability delegation
  - Replit prompts 12, 13, 14 were written to address these bugs
  - react_navigate overhaul designed (AppAgent pattern with planning step before loop)
- **Committed:** Multiple commits via Replit (see git log for 0680269, 93131c6, 82ae5e8, 70f9d24, 680d373)
- **Status:** CANNOT VERIFY FROM CURRENT ARTIFACTS — unknown which Replit prompts are applied in live source
- **Next:** Claude Code to grep-verify prompt application before building on top
